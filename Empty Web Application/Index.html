                        <h3>Sleep Deprivation is a real thing!</h3>
                        If the first thing you say to yourself in the morning is : <br />
                        "Oh, I really shouldn't have watched that extra episode of that 90's rerun at midnight last night". <br />
                        And as you shuffle around your kitchen only not becoming aware that you are accidentally pouring salt instead of sugar into your coffee!<br />
                        We've all been there and done that. Sleep Inc. is here to help manage sleep better with many courses on sleep management skills.

                        “Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” –Aristotle
