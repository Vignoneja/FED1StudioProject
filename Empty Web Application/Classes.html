                    These are used to list items in an ordered way, such as ordered tasks. They use ol (ordered list) container tags and li (List Item) internal tags.

                    Semantic and Non-Semantic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Semantic tags are intended to describe the content they contain, which is true to the generally accepted philosophy behind HTML. Examples of semantic tags would include em and strong. Examples of non-semantic tags are those that just describe the formatting of the content, like i for italic and b for bold. (These tags are a throwback to HTML before CSS was created to handle the appearance of the content.) Typically, the semantic em and strong tags, as well the non-semantic i and b tags, result in italic or bold text, respectively. But saying something looks italic only describes its appearance, whereas marking text up with an em tag means it's emphasized. If we use CSS to change the look of that emphasis (say, changing it to be green and bold), it still makes sense to leave it marked up as emphasized. But it wouldn't make sense for it to still be marked italics if that formatting had been removed. Again - use HTML to apply meaning to content rather than formatting.
